# Forge

todo:
- add data validation editor tools. Make sure data in SO is valid. For example Validate if every recipe output is not null.
- upgrade statistics, move from Player, save which item influances stats etc
- add more structure to UI classes. Explote adding common interface for all Initialize methods
- add proper pooling for Game Objects. That would avoid creating objects for every drag and drop.
- better notifications (List of notifications instead of simple text)
- Machine class could be rewored and use state pattern

- Obviously lots of UI QOL staff:
  - show item names/descriptions
  - show avaliable recipes for machines
  - QOL for dragging items
